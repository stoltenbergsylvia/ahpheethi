The other day, I was discussing Storm with someone, and I realized that there was a period in between the end of X-Treme X-Men and her marriage to Black Panther. I thought to myself, what was Storm doing during that period? So, I dove into my back issues, and I remembered that after X-Treme was cancelled, Claremont actually had a two-year run on Uncanny.

This week's reread is one of my favorites, and also one of the bigger events that the X-Men have done, at least until recently.

Chapter 1 - X-Men: Second Coming #1 So, the mansion is all walled off by HAMMER. You know, Osborn's HAMMER was actually a really well-done storyline I thought. It was an interesting change that was able to be incorporated in all the books without overwhelming everything. That said, it breaks my heart to see that graveyard looking all forlorn, where there are so many good characters buried. I mean, they just put half of Kyle and Yost's X-kids in there after the Purifier massacre.
