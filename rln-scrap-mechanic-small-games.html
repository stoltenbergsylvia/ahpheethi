Mine is elsewhere, but you, Bioware, should have people employed to make sure of a game's quality and find issues in it. Many developers don't need their hand held by a whole community when developing a game, the good ones test and balance it in house until they can say themselves that it's fun. Why do I know that? Because everywhere I've worked has had them. That process has been skipped entirely here. Bioware, your design teams have failed at every. Continue to keep this beginner's scrapapp guide and scrap mechanic for gyroscope games open in a spare tab therefore you will not likely go wrong! tl;dr People are quitting the game not because of a lack of content but due to the lack of meaningful character progression available to them. I’m making this post in response to u/Eowyndra’s post about content and content pacing, which I think is pretty cogent, but doesn’t address the reason that people are leaving the game. However, I am writing this with full acknowledgement of my bias as a mythic raider, and with full understanding of the fact that my community This is the official translation ( with minor additions ) of the original article (https://teletype.in/@korovany/ByWgv5hXE). # First things first: I am the creator of an independent gamedev-themed Telegram channel. Yesterday I published an open letter to Atomic Heart developers asking them to comment on the recent rumors surrounding the game and provide updates. Since then, 11 people have contacted me, 10 of which are confirmed former and current Mundfish developers (the last one being ‘par. Now that the Plantgang is appeased with the release of his potted majesty, and many players are looking to the horizon for more hints, leaks, or any scraps of information about future fighters, I figured it might be a good time to try my hand at another potential Smash Challenger that could really make an impact on the roster This time I wanted to explore one of my favorite modern metroidvanias, a game with unique characters and an incredible story told with very few words, Hollow Knight. 
Dear BioWare, I feel as though we need to have a real talk, man to man. I just don't understand. I've refrained from any negative posting, or talking about the game since launch. I assumed that things would take time to fix and balance, yet here we stand at the first "content drop". All I can say is that you've only taken one step forward, but turned around and dashed straight back. Insulting loot system. Every time there has been adjustments Heads up; this is going to be a long post about how I personally feel about Gwent after the full release of the game, also known as the Homecoming (HC) patch. My previous long post of this kind was during the PTR version of Homecoming (which can be found here (https://www.reddit.com/r/gwent/comments/9lryxj/in_all_honesty_the_ptr_version_of_gwent_feels/)) which came off as incredibly bitchy, mostly due to not liking the new version of the game compared And do not get me wrong, it absolutely still is my #1 favorite game, it just has some. really, really major glaring flaws. Let me pre-emptively apologize for how meandery this post is, and warn you that if you never got far in the game, you might want to avoid the spoilers. If you don't want to read all of it, please read the "What is wrong with CDDA" section, and the "tl;dr/Summary" one, they are the most important outline of what I'm talking about, the rest can be a bit incoherent/implausible. Samus. She’s not good. Let’s fix that. Jab: Plasma blast Samus’s jab is so slow, clunky, and inconsistent, that even the game warns you against using it. Nobody in their right mind would make their character’s most reliable move so unnecessarily hard to use, so we’ll have to scrap it. Her new jab would also be a two hit and jab1 would be virtually identical. However, jab2 is now an electric blue plasma blast from her cannon, coming out much faster. The knockback is roughly the same. (Note: this post assumes that the building AI will be improved in the future; it's getting better already, so that seems reasonable.
